## Minimalistic Portfolio

You do not need to use react to build an overly complicated portfolio, using Angular, React, Next or other frameworks, a simple html css portfolio is all you need.
This portfolio is built using JavaScript HTML, and CSS.
Data is rendered dynamically, but in this case the data is available inside a JSON file.

##### SEO Ready

### What is Available

**html** - `index.html `
Render the data availed, like the users skills, and projects

**db folder** `app.json, data.json `
This files contain the data we are going to render in our markup

**css folder**
This houses all of our custom css

**javascript** `script.js`
This is where we get the data and render it the html file.
**search engine optimization** `robots.txt` `sitemap.xml`

### How to use

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/DidIrb/portfolio.git
```

### Skills

Open `db/data.json` and edit the file.

```
"skills": [
    // other skills
    { "name": "CSS" },
]
```

### Updating the Projects

Take a screen shot of the project

- Compress the image as sometimes the image can be large -

  - Search for an image compressor and compress it - for example use -https://imagecompressor.com/ it does an amazing job

- Copy the compressed image into `public/images` folder.

You can create a gif of you project if you want to show an animated view
open `db/data.json` and edit the file like this

```
"projects": [
    // Other Projects
    {
      "name": "your-projects-name",
      "timeline": "Jan 2024 - Dec 2024",
      "description": "A simple explanation of the project",
      "image": "/public/images/your-image.jpg",
      "light": ["HTML", "CSS"],
      "links": [
        {
          "badgeIcon": "/public/icons/web.svg",
          "badgeText": "Website",
          "link": "https://your-project.com"
        },
        {
          "badgeIcon": "/public/icons/github.svg",
          "badgeText": "Open-Source",
          "link": "https://github.com/profile/your-project"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
```

add as many projects as you want

### Adding more sections

Open `db/app.json` and edit the file to add an additional menu for navigation

```
[
    // other menu items
    {
        "link": "#experience",
        "tooltip": "Experience",
        "icon": "/public/icons/experience.svg",
        "alt": "About me"
    }
],
```

Open the html file and add a new section like this in our case we are adding experience

We are going to add experience section in this example

```
<section id="skills"></section>
<!-- Your code goes here  -->
<section id="experience"></section>
<section id="projects"></section>
```

You are going to design the markup and use css to style it than once you are done

```
<section id="experience">
  <div class="experience-section flex-row">
    <h2 class="name"></h2>
    <div class="timeline"></div>
  </div>
</section>
```
open `db/app.json` add a new object based on the design you have

```
// other objects above
{
"experience" : 
    [
        {
            "name": "company 1",
            "timeline": "company 2"
        },
        // add more here
    ]
}
```

open `script.js`

Here now you are going to get the json data and append the data into the section you just created

now remove the html code from index.html as we are going to use javascript to loop though and append the data using the id of the section which is `education` update the js file like this


```
// Render the education content here 
  const experienceContainer = 
  document.getElementById("experience-section");
  data.experience.forEach((experience) => {
    const experienceDiv = document.createElement("div");
    experienceDiv.innerHTML = `
        <div class="experience">
        <h2 class="name">${experience.name}</h2>
        <div class="timeline">${experience.timeline}</div>
      </div>
      `;
      experienceContainer.appendChild(experienceDiv);
  });
```


And like that you have added another section,

<!-- I kind of got tired writing this so you can update it if you want -->
